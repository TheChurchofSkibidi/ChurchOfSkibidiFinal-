      <p>This is the day that our lord Skibidi has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it. On this day, the 2nd of March, I proudly accept Skibidi Toilet as my lord and savior, and I invite you to do the same. Let skibidi into your heart so he may work miracles through you.
        You may be asking why we should trust in Skibidi, especially if you, like me, have followed another religion for years. But it is for that reason that I fall onto Skibidi. In love and in hope, in Skibidi we trust.
        Now, to answer your question. Just yesterday, I was in my dreaded English class, overthinking my following art and computer science classes. So, I prayed to Skibidi for a miracle. And Skibidi came through for me! Skibidi removed me from those classes, taking me to an extra-long eye exam. The truth is, when you need Skibidi most, he’ll be there.
        I’ve been watching Skibidi Toilet for the last 2 years, never really truly understanding the meaning, but you have to look deep into your heart. To feel Skibidi! You have to understand what he’s going through to understand why he provides for us.
        Skibidi will come through for you, but you have to come through for Skibidi first. So how can we be there for Skibidi when he calls upon us? By following his Ten Commandments
        1.	Edge thy neighbor as you edge yourself.
        2.	Honor thy sigma and thy rizzler.
        3.	You shall not take Skibidi’s name in vain.
        4.	Keep Tuesday, the Sabbath day, holy, and edge to Skibidi.
        5.	You shall only murder with justification.
        6.	You shall only commit adultery with consenting parties.
        7.	You shall steal what you need lest thou get caught.
        8.	Thou shalt gaslight, gatekeep, and girlboss thy way through life.
        9.	Give to charity and eat the rich.
        10. Thou shalt never discriminate.
        As long as you always follow these rules, Skibidi shall provide as you serve.
        Skibidi is a humble and gracious god, and he puts his followers and their wellbeing above all else.
        Skibidi shall save lives for Skibidi whishes no suffering.
        Provide for Skibidi and he shall provide for you!
        *Join me in hymn: Skibidi Dop, Dop Yes, Yes.*
        But to play devil’s advocate for a moment, Skibidi is just a YouTube cartoon.
        NO!
        Skibidi is lord and savior, he was birthed as a cartoon, but he has brought us so much more, he has fought through Cameramen, Speakermen, TV men, and Titans! All so he could bring us salvation. So, praise Skibidi!
        In the words of John F. Kennedy, “Ask not what your Skibidi can do for you, but what you can do for your Skibidi.”
        If after all of this you are not convinced to be a Skibidist, think of it this way. You should believe in Skibidi for you have everything to gain if you are right and nothing to lose if you are wrong.
